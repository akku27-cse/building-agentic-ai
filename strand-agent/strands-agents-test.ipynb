      "**Goal-directed behavior**: They work toward specific outcomes, adapting their approach based on changing circumstances.\n",

      "## Current Examples\n",
      "\n",
      "- **AI assistants** that can break down complex requests into subtasks and execute them\n",
      "- **Autonomous vehicles** that navigate and make driving decisions\n",
      "- **Trading algorithms** that buy and sell based on market conditions\n",
      "- **Game-playing AI** like AlphaGo that develops novel strategies\n",

      "## Potential Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "- Personal digital assistants that manage schedules and tasks\n",

      "- Creative collaboration tools\n",

      "**Serverless Computing**: You write and upload your code, and AWS automatically handles the infrastructure, scaling, and availability.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Event-Driven**: Lambda functions are triggered by events from other AWS services, HTTP requests, or scheduled events.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How It Works\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Upload your code** as a deployment package or container image\n",
      "2. **Set up triggers** (API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, etc.)\n",
      "3. **Lambda automatically runs** your function when triggered\n",
      "4. **Automatic scaling** from zero to thousands of concurrent executions\n",
      "5. **Pay only for execution time** (no idle server costs)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Supported Languages\n",

      "- Node.js\n",
